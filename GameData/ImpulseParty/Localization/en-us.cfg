		#LOC_IMPP_core_descA = No starship is complete without its beating heart, the fusion core. When available, this core will also, with lower priority, produce and hold abundant ElectroPlasma which can be decompressed for ElectricCharge or used by fluid plasma RCS thrusters.
		#LOC_IMPP_core_descB = Unlike its brothers, this fusion reactor is not meant to be primary, but a secondary power source. When available, this core will produce and prefer ElectroPlasma, which is useful for fluid plasma RCS thrusters and more helpful as a capacitor system for keeping the batteries full in very small crafts.
