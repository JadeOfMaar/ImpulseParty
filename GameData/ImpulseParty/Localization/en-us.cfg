		#LOC_IMPP_coreS3_title = DS Wolf-Rayet S3 Fusion Core
		#LOC_IMPP_core_descA = No starship is complete without its beating heart, the fusion core. When available, this core will also, with lower priority, produce and hold abundant ElectroPlasma which can be decompressed for ElectricCharge or used by fluid plasma RCS thrusters.
		#LOC_IMPP_core_descB = Unlike its brothers, this fusion reactor is not meant to be primary, but a secondary power source. When available, this core will produce and prefer ElectroPlasma, which is useful for fluid plasma RCS thrusters and more helpful as a capacitor system for keeping the batteries full in very small crafts.

		#LOC_IMPP_impengS1_title = DS Wolf-Rayet S1 Fusion Rocket
		#LOC_IMPP_impengS2_title = DS Wolf-Rayet S2 Fusion Rocket
		#LOC_IMPP_impeng_desc = Forever playing with increasingly hot fire, kerbal scientists found that the controlled venting of a fusion reactor's core is as effective as anything for producing thrust.
		
		#LOC_IMPP_nacLowerMk2_title = DS Kelvin Warp Nacelle Mk2 Lower Body
		#LOC_IMPP_nacLowerMk2_desc = This Kelvin family warp coil is an adapter, rated for use alongside S3 series warp engines.
		#LOC_IMPP_nacSeg_title = DS Kelvin Warp Nacelle Segment
		#LOC_IMPP_nacSeg_desc = The 3.126m segment for the Kelvin family warp nacelle, rated for use alongside S3 series warp engines.
		#LOC_IMPP_nacTailMk2_title = DS Kelvin Warp Nacelle Mk2 Tail
		#LOC_IMPP_nacTailMk2_desc = A tail segment for Mk2 class warp coil stacks. It is rated for use with S2 or Mk2 warp cores.
		#LOC_IMPP_nacUpper_title = DS Kelvin Warp Nacelle Upper Body
		#LOC_IMPP_nacUpper_desc = The 2.5m ~ 3.126m upper segment for the Kelvin family warp nacelle, rated for use alongside S3 series warp engines.

		#LOC_IMPP_scoopS3_title = DS Urlum Particle Collector S3
		#LOC_IMPP_scoop_desc = This extremely advanced particle collector fits your favorite frame without taking up a lot of space when running. It is pretty fragile so be extra careful. Warranty void if used in atmosphere.
