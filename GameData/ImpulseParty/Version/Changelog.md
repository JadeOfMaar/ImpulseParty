# Impulse Party

## 0.6
* Added and fixed Tweakscale for nav dishes.
* Fixed attachment symmetry problems which leads to undesired reverse thrust situations and one or more engines burning off the part they are attached to. This may cause invalid orientation of some attachments of the engine on some crafts.
* Fixed StoredCharge conversion ratio in Mk2 NF-alike capacitors.
* Updated shields config to not cause the multiple ModuleAblator issue with OPT.

## 0.5
* Added Nav Deflector parts, including separate models for the shield projection standalone.
* Raise heat tolerances for fusion reactors, Mk1 warp core and Mk2 batteries.

## 0.4
* Added 0.625m parts: Priax series warp nacelles and Kelvin series scoop.
* Added Extras:
  * Hard Balance (when WBI mods absent) tunes impulse rockets to feel like Nertea's mods.
  * Moved warp coils upgrade patch here.
  * Moved harvesters free animation patch here.

## 0.3
